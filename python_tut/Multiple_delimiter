1) how do you debug the Python program?
python -m pdb python-script.py

2)what is yield keyword in python?

A) the yield keyword in python can return any function into a generator.
yields work like a standard return keywords

But its always return a generator objects.

def testgen(index):
weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
yield weekdays[index]
yield weekdays[index+1]
day = testgen(0)
for i in day:
    print(i)


3) how to convert list into string:
 When we want to convert a list into a string,
 we can use the <”.join()> method which joins all the elements into one and returns as a string.

weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
listAsString = ' '.join(weekdays)
print(listAsString)P

4)how to convert list to tuple:
weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat']
listAsTuple = tuple(weekdays)
print(listAsTuple)

5)how to convert list to set:
weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sat','sun','tue']
listAsSet = set(weekdays)
print(listAsSet)


6)how to convert the occurrences of particular elements in the list?
weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print(weekdays.count('mon'))

Example # 2:

weekdays = ['sun','mon','tue','wed','thu','fri','sun','mon','mon']
print([[x,weekdays.count(x)] for x in set(weekdays)])

9) What is a negative index in Python?

A) Python has a special feature like a negative index in Arrays and Lists.
Positive index reads the elements from the starting of an array or list but in the negative index,
 Python reads elements from the end of an array or list.

10) What is the output of the below code?

>> import array
>>> a = [1, 2, 3]
>>> print a[-3]
>>> print a[-2]
>>> print a[-1]
A) The output is: 3, 2, 1

11) What is the output of the below program?
names = ['Chris', 'Jack', 'John', 'Daman']
print(names[-1][-1])

12) What is Enumerate() Function in Python?

A) The Python enumerate() function adds a counter to an iterable object.
enumerate() function can accept sequential indexes starting from zero.

subjects = ('Python', 'Interview', 'Questions')
for i, subject in enumerate(subjects):
print(i, subject)
Output:

0 Python
1 Interview
2 Questions

14) How do you Concatenate Strings in Python?

A) We can use ‘+’ to concatenate strings.

Python Concatenating Example:

# See how to use ‘+’ to concatenate strings.

>>> print('Python' + ' Interview' + ' Questions')
# Output:

15) How to generate random numbers in Python?

A) We can generate random numbers using different functions in Python. They are:

#1. random() – This command returns a floating point number, between 0 and 1.

#2. uniform(X, Y) – It returns a floating point number between the values given as X and Y.

#3. randint(X, Y) – This command returns a random integer between the values given as X and Y.

16) How to print sum of the numbers starting from 1 to 100?

A) We can print sum of the numbers starting from 1 to 100 using this code:

print sum(range(1,101))

20) What is the output when we execute list(“hello”)?

A) [‘h’, ‘e’, ‘l’, ‘l’, ‘o’]
